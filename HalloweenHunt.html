    <h2>General</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 160px">For Halloween hunt I made the AI seeker, which fully reacts to the players behavior.<br>
	The players pitch against each other to get the most candy (points), and each time they are caught by the seeker, they lose 1 candy<br>
	It starts by walking to a random side of the level, at that location looks around, and follows the player.<br>
	It's fully event based, meaning the only thing it will do on tick is walk towards a goal destination. everything else, including what this destination is, is calculated on events<br>
	This made it a really optimized AI, while it still is a really realistic seeker.</p>
	<video id="Trailer" width="50%" height="auto" style="float:left; margin: 0 20px 10px 0;" controls><source src="video/HalloweenHuntTrailer.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
	<!--<button onclick="playPauseTrailer()" style="float:left; clear:both;">Play/Pause trailer</button>-->
	<h2 id="Idle" >Idle</h2>
	<p>
		While the seeker has no known player it follows, he will go to random locations in the level.<br>
		There are 8 checkpoints located in the level, each with different rotators the seeker will look towards.<br>
		At reaching one of those locations, a event is fired to choose a new location<br>
		The event for going to a idle location is called every-time the seeker reaches his goal, and no other mode is fired in the meantime
	</p>
	<h2 id="SeenPlayer">Seen player</h2>
	<p>
		The seeker has a vision cone which checks once a second for players in sight<br>
		When a player is seen, a event is fired for going to an active way-point, this overwrites the idle behavior and makes the AI go to the location he sees the player.<br>
		When the seeker is going to the location it last saw a player, it will check twice a second for still seeing the player, and update the active way-point accordingly.
		Making him keep track of the player, but also able to lose sight.<br>
	</p>
	<h2 id="HeardSound">Heard Sound</h2>
	<p>
		To make it a bit harder for players, of to lure the seeker into another player, The player makes a sound when picking up a candy, which lures the seeker to that location.<br>
		This event is only fired if the AI doesn't already have a player in his sight. Which makes it possible to get candy without getting the seeker following you in some cases.<br>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>For A Toon York Story I worked on the ai, which included a few relatively simple enemy ai's, and a bigger boss fight.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately we could not finish the game, because of a lack of motivation coming from the art side of the team.</p>
    <h2 id="Simple">Simple Enemies</h2>
	<p>The simple enemies are all based of off 1 statemachine in which the different states can be turned on and off.<br>
	For example the first enemy type you come across is very dumb, and only has a walking state enabled, and so can only walk left/right till the platform ends.<br>
	While the second enemy has a state called "attack player" enabled, with which it will attack the player if he or she is in range.</p>

	<img id="imgRight" src="images/ToonYork/Shooter.gif" alt="Shooter" title="Shooter">
	<h2 id="Boss" style="clear:both;">Multi Stage Boss</h2>
	<p>The boss has 3 stages wich are unlocked sequentially by health %.<br>
	in each stage, the boss has to be hit in a different way, and will unlock a new attack to damage the player.</p>
	<h3>Stage 1, Bubble's and Crates.</h3>
	<p>In the first stage, the boss has 1 attack, which is a Bubble attack made for air control.<br>
	With this attack, it shoots up a X amount of bubbles which come back down on the player with an arch.<br><br>
	The defined way of hurting the Boss in stage one is by dropping crates on him.<br>
	In the level, there are multiple crates hanging from the roof, which the player can drop by hitting it with the grappling hook. while the other player is leading the ai underneath the crate.<br></p>

	<img id="imgRight" src="images/ToonYork/BossFallingObject.gif" alt="Falling Crate" title="Falling Crate"> 
    <h3  style="clear:both;">Stage 2, Dash and spikes.</h3>
	<p>Starting this stage, the boss unlocks a dash attack, with which it will speed up for a certain amount of seconds, which can't be interupted by the player or anything else.<br>
	The way to damage the boss in this stage is not by the falling crate's anymore, but by using the dash to lure him into spikes which are located around the level.</p>
	<img id="imgLeft" src="images/ToonYork/BossDashAndSpawn.gif" alt="Dash" style="margin-left:200px" title="Dash attack and spawning stage 3"> <p style="font-style: italic; font-size:0.7em">note: also shows spawning for next stage</p>
	<h3 style="clear:both;">Stage 3, Grab and minions.</h3>
	<p>In the third and final stage, the boss spawns minions to attack the player, besides that, he learns a new attack which is a grapple with which it can grab and pull the players toward himself.<br>
	The way to damage the Boss in this level, is by hitting stunned ai's into him, one of the players is able to stunn the enemies, and then the other player can hit the stunned ai, and instead of it directly dieing, it will shoot away.<br>
	When this shot enemy hits the boss, it will do damage.</p>
